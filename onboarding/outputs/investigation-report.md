The Investigation Report is a comprehensive document that details the findings and observations made by the valuation professional and their team during the on-site property inspection. While not mandatory, providing this report to the client can help ensure transparency, clarity, and alignment throughout the valuation process.

The Investigation Report typically includes the following sections:

1. **Property Identification:**
   * Basic information about the property, such as its address, legal description, and any unique identifiers.
   * Photographs of the property, including exterior and interior views, to provide visual context.
2. **Inspection Details:**
   * Date and time of the inspection, along with the names and roles of the individuals who conducted the inspection.
   * A description of the scope and purpose of the inspection, as well as any limitations or restrictions encountered.
3. **Property Description:**
   * A detailed account of the property's physical characteristics, including its size, layout, construction materials, and condition.
   * Information about any improvements, renovations, or additions made to the property.
   * A description of the property's age, architectural style, and overall quality.
4. **Site and Location Analysis:**
   * An assessment of the property's site, including its topography, accessibility, and any environmental factors that may impact its value.
   * A description of the surrounding neighborhood, including its character, amenities, and any relevant market trends.
   * Identification of nearby comparable properties and their potential influence on the subject property's value.
5. **Building Systems and Services:**
   * An evaluation of the property's major building systems, such as its structural integrity, electrical and plumbing systems, and HVAC equipment.
   * A description of any additional services or amenities provided, such as security systems, elevators, or parking facilities.
6. **Condition Assessment:**
   * A detailed assessment of the property's current condition, noting any defects, deferred maintenance, or areas requiring repair or replacement.
   * Photographs documenting specific issues or concerns identified during the inspection.
7. **Compliance and Zoning:**
   * An analysis of the property's compliance with applicable building codes, zoning regulations, and other legal requirements.
   * Identification of any permits, licenses, or certificates that may impact the property's use or value.
8. **Valuation Implications:**
   * A summary of how the inspection findings may influence the property's market value or suitability for its intended use.
   * Identification of any factors that may require further investigation or specialist input.

The Investigation Report is generated within the InterVal platform, allowing valuation professionals to easily input their findings, upload photographs, and organize the information in a structured manner. The report can be securely stored and accessed by authorized parties, facilitating collaboration and information sharing.

By providing a thorough and well-documented Investigation Report, valuation professionals can  enhance the credibility of their valuation conclusions and build trust with their clients. This report serves as a valuable reference point throughout the valuation process, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the property's physical characteristics and condition.
