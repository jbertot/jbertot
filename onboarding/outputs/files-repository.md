# Files Repository

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/File Repository" alt=""><figcaption><p>File Repository</p></figcaption></figure>

The Files Repository is a centralized storage solution within the InterVal platform that houses all the essential documents, reports, and files related to a specific Target Property. Located in the Online Repository section of the valuation, the Files Repository can be accessed by the valuation professional and their team, as well as the client if they have been granted access to this section.

The Files Repository serves as a comprehensive archive of all the key materials generated throughout the valuation process, ensuring that all stakeholders have easy access to the information they need. The repository includes:

1. **Generated Reports:**
   * All the reports created within the InterVal platform for the Target Property, such as the Valuation Report, Draft Valuation Statement, and Investigation Report.
   * These reports are automatically stored in the repository upon generation, maintaining a complete record of the valuation outputs.
2. **PDF and Other File Attachments:**
   * Any additional documents or files that are relevant to the valuation, such as property deeds, leases, or market research reports.
   * These files can be uploaded to the repository by authorized users, ensuring that all pertinent information is kept together in one place.
3. **High-Resolution Pictures:**
   * All photographs of the Target Property, including exterior and interior views, site photographs, and any other relevant images.
   * The repository stores these pictures at the original resolution they were uploaded, preserving their quality and detail for future reference.

One of the key benefits of the Files Repository is the ability to download all the stored files in a single zip file. This zip file is organized into a well-structured system of folders and subfolders, making it easy for users to navigate and locate specific files. The folder structure is designed to be intuitive and logical, grouping related documents and files together for easy access.

For example, the zip file might include top-level folders for "Reports," "Attachments," and "Pictures," with subfolders within each category further organizing the files by type, date, or other relevant criteria. This structured approach to file organization ensures that clients, auditors, and the valuation team can quickly find the information they need, even when working with the downloaded files offline.

The Files Repository is designed with security and accessibility in mind. Access to the repository is controlled through InterVal's permission settings, ensuring that only authorized individuals can view, download, or modify the stored files. This secure environment helps protect sensitive information and maintains the confidentiality of the valuation process.

By providing a centralized and organized storage solution, the Files Repository streamlines the management and sharing of valuation-related documents and files. It eliminates the need for manual file transfers and reduces the risk of lost or misplaced information, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the valuation process.

The Files Repository is an essential component of InterVal's Online Repository section, working in tandem with other features such as the Audit Trail Report and the Valuation Dashboard to provide a comprehensive and transparent record of the valuation process. By leveraging the Files Repository, valuation professionals can enhance collaboration, improve client communication, and ensure that all stakeholders have access to the information they need to make informed decisions.
