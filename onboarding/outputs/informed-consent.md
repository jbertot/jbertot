# Informed Consent

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Informed Consent - Sample Doc" alt=""><figcaption><p>Informed Consent - Sample Doc</p></figcaption></figure>

By obtaining Informed Consent, the valuer ensures that the client is fully aware of the nature and limitations of the valuation service, and that they accept the associated risks and responsibilities. This process helps to establish a clear understanding between the valuer and the client, minimizing the potential for misunderstandings or disputes.

InterVal's Informed Consent feature streamlines the process of creating and managing these important documents, ensuring that valuers can efficiently communicate the key aspects of the valuation service to their clients and secure their informed acceptance of the terms and conditions. This feature helps to promote transparency, professionalism, and compliance with industry standards in the valuation process.
