# Miscellaneous

**The Miscellaneous page is dedicated to highlighting some unique and specific features of InterVal that don't fit neatly into other sections of the documentation. These features are integral to maximizing the utility of InterVal and ensuring that you can leverage all the advanced capabilities of the platform.**

## Valuation Features

Valuation is a critical component of property management and real estate transactions. InterVal provides a range of advanced valuation features that help you tailor your valuations to meet specific requirements and scenarios. This section covers some of the unique valuation functionalities available in InterVal.

1. [<mark style="color:blue;">**Liquidation Value**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">:</mark>](../../workflow/valuation/miscellaneous/liquidation-value.md) This feature guides you on how to manage and incorporate liquidation value when it is requested in the terms of engagement. Liquidation value refers to the estimated amount that could be quickly obtained from the sale of a property under distressed conditions, often lower than the fair market value. InterVal provides tools and templates to help you accurately calculate and report liquidation values as required.
2. [<mark style="color:blue;">**Adding Valuation Scenarios**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">:</mark>](../../workflow/valuation/miscellaneous/adding-scenarios.md) InterVal allows you to add and compare multiple valuation scenarios based on different sets of data. For example, you might perform two comparable valuations using different sets of comparables for each. This feature helps you explore various outcomes and choose the most appropriate valuation for your needs. It is particularly useful for clients who require a comprehensive analysis of potential market conditions or different investment strategies.
3. [<mark style="color:blue;">**Freehold to Leasehold Conversion**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">:</mark>](../../workflow/valuation/miscellaneous/freehold-to-leasehold-conversion.md) InterVal offers a feature to facilitate the conversion of a freehold property to a leasehold property. This includes tools to help you calculate the leasehold value, set the lease terms, and evaluate the financial implications of the conversion. This feature ensures that all aspects of the conversion are accurately represented and documented.
4. [**Headline to Effective Rent Conversion**:](../../workflow/valuation/miscellaneous/headline-to-effective-rent-conversion.md) InterVal includes a tool to convert headline rent to effective rent. Headline rent is the rent agreed upon at the beginning of a lease, while effective rent takes into account incentives such as rent-free periods, fit-out contributions, or any other concessions provided by the landlord. This tool helps you provide a more accurate reflection of the net rent the tenant will actually pay over the lease term, which is crucial for precise financial analysis and reporting.

## Assignment Features

Managing assignments efficiently is crucial for smooth operations. InterVal provides a suite of features designed to help you manage and streamline your assignments, from quotes to final terms of engagement.

1. [<mark style="color:blue;">**Manage Your Quotes**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">:</mark>](../../workflow/assignments/quotes-list.md) This page allows you to monitor the status of all your quotes. You can track which quotes have been sent, viewed, accepted, or rejected by clients. This feature provides a centralized view of all your quotes, helping you stay organized and follow up as necessary.
2. [<mark style="color:blue;">**Create a New Quote**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">:</mark>](../../workflow/assignments/quote-form/) This feature simplifies the process of creating new quotes. It uses a form similar to the terms of engagement form but is extremely simplified for quick generation of quotes. Once a quote is accepted by the client, it can be rapidly converted into a terms of engagement, streamlining the transition from quote to active project.
