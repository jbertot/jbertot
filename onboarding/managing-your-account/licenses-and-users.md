# Licenses & Users

The **Licenses & Users** section in InterVal allows administrators to manage user access dynamically, ensuring optimal license utilization and efficient team management. This page provides an overview of the features and processes for managing licenses and users in your InterVal system.

### 1 - How Licenses Work in InterVal <a href="#id-1-1---how-licenses-work-in-interval" id="id-1-1---how-licenses-work-in-interval"></a>

Licenses are purchased for a specific period and can be dynamically assigned and unassigned to users as needed. This system allows you to:

* Efficiently manage teams by assigning licenses only to active users.
* Unassign licenses from inactive users and reassign them to others, maximizing value.
* Maintain user records permanently, even if their licenses are unassigned.

For example, with a team of 10 users but only 5 licenses, you can assign licenses to active users and reassign them as necessary.
