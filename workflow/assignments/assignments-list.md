# Assignments List

**The Assignment List page in InterVal provides an overview of all the valuation assignments, allowing users to efficiently manage and track their projects. An assignment serves as a folder or placeholder that contains one or more Terms of Engagement (TOEs). TOEs cannot exist without being linked to an assignment, ensuring that all valuation projects are properly organized and easily accessible.**
