# Conflicts of Interest

Identifying and declaring conflicts of interest is essential to maintain the integrity and objectivity of the valuation process, in accordance with RICS standards. Conflicts of interest must be transparently disclosed to ensure that all parties are aware of any potential biases that could influence the valuation outcome.

While InterVal cannot predict specific conflicts of interest that a valuer or agency might encounter, and given the wide variety of possible conflicts, we have implemented a system to help you filter and identify relevant conflicts. This ensures that no potential conflicts are overlooked.

Once a conflict is identified, and if the valuer is still able to proceed with the assignment, the system will generate an informed consent document for the client to sign, acknowledging their awareness and acceptance of the disclosed conflict.
