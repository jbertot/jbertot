# Reporting

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* The first step in the “General valuation matters” section requires valuers to select, if there are several, which valuation result to report to the client after having reconciled the different methods and scenarios’ values. (1)
* It also asks valuers to indicat ethe valuation date that will be on the report, which can be different than the date of the report itself.
* If there are more than one signatory to be included in the valuation report, you can choose which other member part of the team will have a signature box. (3)
* Because rapid market fluctuations may impact a property value, It is important to indicate it in the report if there has been any material change in market conditions between the valuation and reporting dates. (4)
* For great figures, it is sometimes easier to round up the value instead of having long list of numericla characters. If you wish to do so, you can do just that using this feature. (5)

* You may add other documents in the appendix of the valuation report, such as small general market or sector specific brief, supporting documents such as measurement standard explanation, your company standard Insurance policy, etc. All documents available in Interval Appendix section can be retrieved from there (6)
* In addition, you can also amend the initial files included in the TOE such as the company certificates or the valuers and other team members professional qualifications and the like. (7)
* Any other external document you may wish to upload and include in the valuation report may be uploaded here.
