# Intro

The valuation reporting task, the last step before producing the valuation report, gives valuers the opportunity to fine tune the last elements of the valuation before concluding their job. It provides an overview of the results of each valuation made on the asset – if there are several – and asks valuers the last details before exporting the report.
