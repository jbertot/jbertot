# Design

**Property pictures are a crucial element to include in a valuation report as they play a vital role in helping users of the report identify and assess the property state. As such, the Report Design page gives interval users the tool to display the pictures at their convenience in the report with multiple options. Organising your pictures properly may help make the report easier to read and more understandable.**

* The second step is choosing what picture will be displayed on your valuation report, whether your default Agency cover page, or one of the target property or building pictures you have taken (2)
