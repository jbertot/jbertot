# Introduction to the Online Repository

InterVal's Online Repository feature provides a centralized location where users can store all of the reports and multimedia (pictures, videos, graphs, etc.) related to a specific ToE. A password protected link to this repository can be safely shared with Clients and other relevant third parties. The repository thus serves as a storage point and also enhances transparency and communication with Clients.

You can navigate to the Online repository from the ToE Dashboard page by clicking on the link under the Multimedia column in the TOE summary table, as shown on the screenshot below.
