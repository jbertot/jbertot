# Simple Vs Advanced Mode

**The Property Form in InterVal is a vital tool for managing and updating information about the comparable properties used in the valuation process. This form allows users to input and organize a wide range of data points for each comparable property, ensuring that valuers have access to accurate and reliable information when conducting their analyses.**

## 1 - Simple Mode

At the top of the Property Form, users can toggle between two modes: Simple and Advanced. The Simple mode offers a streamlined view of the most crucial property information fields, such as property type, address, size, number of rooms, and key amenities. This mode is ideal for users who need to quickly input essential details for a large number of comparable properties without being bogged down by extensive data entry.

## 2 - Advanced Mode

On the other hand, the Advanced mode of the Property Form provides users with a comprehensive set of fields to capture a broad spectrum of property characteristics. This mode is designed for valuers who require a more detailed and thorough approach to comparable property data management. In addition to the basic fields available in Simple mode, the Advanced mode includes sections and fields such as construction materials, heating and cooling systems, energy efficiency ratings, parking facilities, renovation history, and more. This extensive set of data points enables valuers to develop a deep understanding of each comparable property and its potential impact on the valuation of the target property.

The ability to switch between Simple and Advanced modes allows users to customize the Property Form based on their specific valuation needs and the level of detail required for each comparable property. Valuers can select the appropriate mode based on factors such as the complexity of the property, the availability of information, and the time constraints of the valuation project. This flexibility ensures that users can efficiently manage comparable property data while maintaining the depth of information necessary for accurate and reliable valuations.
