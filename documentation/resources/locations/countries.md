# Countries

**Efficiently manage your valuation projects by setting up country-specific information. This page allows you to add and manage countries within your system, linking each agency to their respective country. This setup is crucial for organizing and utilizing the relevant information for your assignments. After adding countries, you will also have the opportunity to specify cities to tailor the system to your needs further.**

It requires valuers to identify and highlight any factors that could lead to material uncertainty in the valuation. For example, in France, complex and varying regulations across different regions, such as rent control measures and zoning restrictions, may impact property values and lead to valuation uncertainty.
6. **Add VPGA10 Matter:** Clicking the "+" button allows you to add additional VPGA10 matters specific to the country.
7. **Delete VPGA10 Matter:** Clicking the "-" button next to a VPGA10 matter removes it from the list.

For example, in France, public domain information is generally well-maintained and accessible through various government agencies and online platforms. However, the level of detail and ease of access may differ depending on the location and type of property.
9. **Cancel:** Clicking this button discards any unsaved changes made to the country's details and closes the editing form.
10. **Save:** Clicking the "Save" button applies the changes made to the country's information and closes the editing form.
