# Buildings List

**The Buildings Database is a dedicated section within InterVal that allows users to store, manage, and access information specific to the buildings in which the properties are located. This separate database complements the Comparables Database by providing a centralized location to input, update, and reference building-level data, avoiding duplication of efforts and ensuring that all relevant information is easily accessible.**

The Buildings Database is particularly useful for properties located within larger buildings or complexes, such as residential apartments, commercial offices, and retail spaces. By maintaining building-specific data separately, valuers can efficiently manage and link this information to the individual properties listed in the Comparables Database, streamlining the valuation process and promoting consistency and accuracy.
