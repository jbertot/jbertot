# Valuation Summary (Comparable)

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* The valuation tab(s) highlights the results and main features of the valuation carried out on the asset (1). There is as many valuation tabs as there are valuations made on the property. This includes the valuations with several scenarios (say two comparable valuations made with two different set of comparable properties) and other valuations with different methods (income DCF and Terms & Reversion  for instance);
* The second module fof the tab named “Valuatio specifics” shows the basis of value, approach and method selected for this valuation among other information (2);
* The third module summarises the milestones for the job, incluing the due delivery date (3);
* The fourth module shows the results of the valuation, here a comparable valuation, including details on the comparable properties, the total adjustment made, and final property value (4).
