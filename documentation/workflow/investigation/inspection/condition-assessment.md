# Condition Assessment

The Condition assessment tab’s purpose is to report on the state of the property at the time of inspection and record any potential environmental issues in the asset itself or in its direct vicinity.

### 1 – Condition Rating <a href="#id-1-1---condition-rating" id="id-1-1---condition-rating"></a>

1. **Condition rating:** the table framework is based on the measurement reporting standard adopted for the property. Consequently, each property is broken into component area (i.e. Living or working space, vertical circulation area, hygiene area, etc) based on available property measurement standards (IPMS).
2. **Rating:** The condition rating table is designed to allow valuers to rate each part of the property and inform the client of potential repairs that may need to be carried out. There are three levels of rating and two other choice options:
   * **Rate 1** - No repair is currently needed. The property must be maintained in the normal way.
   * **Rate 2** - Defects that need repairing or replacing but are not considered to be either serious or urgent. The property must be maintained in the normal way.
   * **Rate 3** - Defects that are serious and/or need to be repaired, replaced or investigated urgently.
   * **Not applicable:** N/A.
   * **Not inspected:** N/I if a part of a property cannot be inspected.
3. **Description:** you can add a written description to report on a specific topic as part of your condition rating by clicking on the edit icon.

### 2 - Property Observation checklist for identifying potential environmental issues <a href="#id-2-2---property-observation-checklist-for-identifying-potential-environmental-issues" id="id-2-2---property-observation-checklist-for-identifying-potential-environmental-issues"></a>

1. **Choice of record:** you can either manually enter the information or upload a checklist of your own.
2. **Area inspected:** interval allows you to report potential environmental issues in and out the property in specific areas: the Building Basement and subterranean features (e.g. air raid shelters); Outbuilding, including garages and stores; Gardens; Surrounding areas and Extent.
3. **Presence of potential environmental matters:** if any of the following has been observed (Renewables; Asbestos; Fly Tipping; Oil fuel Tanks; above or below ground bunded; Other tanks or containers; Incineration areas; Septic tank overflow; Oil staining; Invasive non-native species; Irregular topography; Vegetation dieback; Utilities) in one of the areas inspected, ten it should be reported on
4. **Past and current use:** if the valuers observed during the investigation process that the property may be at risk of disaster or natural events (flooding, mineral extraction nearby) then it should be reported here.
