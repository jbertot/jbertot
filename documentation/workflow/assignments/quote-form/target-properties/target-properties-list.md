# Target Properties List

This tab allows you to manage the properties, including adding new ones, duplicating existing entries, and updating their statuses. Proper management of this tab ensures that all relevant properties are accurately documented and assessed.

1. **Target Property Table:** The table lists all the target properties to be valued for this Terms of Engagement. It includes columns for property ID, surface area, sub-type, type of investigation, number of valuations, status, and actions.
2. **Add Target Property:** Click to add a target property from a blank.
3. **Status of the Target Property:** Indicates the status of each target property. A "Draft" status means that some fields still need to be edited. A "Validated" status means the property details are complete and ready for valuation.
