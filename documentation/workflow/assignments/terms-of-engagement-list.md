# Terms of Engagement List

The Terms of Engagement (ToE) List page provides an overview of all the ToEs associated with a specific assignment. It allows users to manage and track the progress of each ToE, as well as perform actions such as adding new ToEs or editing assignment details.

1. **All ToEs:** In addition to the assignment-specific ToE list, users can also access a separate ToE List page that provides an overview of all ToEs across all assignments. This consolidated view allows users to quickly search, filter, and manage ToEs from a single location, regardless of the assignment they belong to. The ToE List page offers similar functionality and actions as the assignment-specific ToE list, enabling users to maintain a high-level perspective on their entire ToE portfolio.

## 3 - Duplicating a Terms of Engagement (ToE)

The duplicate ToE modal allows users to create a copy of an existing ToE, streamlining the process for recurring assignments. Users can choose to duplicate all target properties or select specific ones to include in the new ToE.
