# Adding Scenarios

In the course of the valuation process users may wish to try out different data sets in their valuation such as alternative comparable property evidences or rental and yield information. The Add a scenario feature allows users to do just that by giving the possibility to do as many alternative valuations as you wish. You can later select one of those results if you deem it more appropriate in the Reporting page of the valuation.

The add a scenario is actionable through the green addition symbol in the Action menu on the right of the task panel (1).

You can either choose to create a blank scenario based on the same valuation methodology as the first valuation (1), or duplicate the data and results of the existing valuation for further finetuning and adjustment (2)
