# Adjustments

The adjustment tab gives valuers the tools to make adjustments to the comparables selected based on their characteristics and overall condition compared to the target property being valued.

### 1 – Sizes <a href="#id-1-1---sizes" id="id-1-1---sizes"></a>

1. **Table:** This table references all size entries available for the comparables and the target property according to different measurement standards. The  measurement standard selected in the T.O.E. is indicated for reference  purposes. Some comparables’ sizes may be initially reported on another basis as the one adopted by the user, in which case one has the possibility to provide a converted figure.
2. **Size selection:** Users must indicate with which size they wish  to continue the valuation process using the action check validation.
3. **Overview:** a look at the comparables or the target property details is accessible through the blue eye icon in the table.
4. **Comparable deletion:** if necessary, users can remove a comparable from the list by clicking on the red bin icon
