# Summary

The summary page allows the users to step back and look at the valuation results, to make sure that valuation results are consistent with market trends.

1. **Map:** the map shows the location of the target property being valued and the comparables.
2. **Valuation summary table:** the table shows the results of the valuation performed on the asset. It focuses on the main metrics and output values rather than input data. It shows the property value on a per unit and as a whole basis.
