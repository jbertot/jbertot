# Summary

The summary page allows the users to step back and look at the valuation results, to make sure that valuation results are consistent with market trends.

1. **Map:** the map shows the location of the target property being valued and the comparables.
2. **Valuation summary table:** the table shows the results of the valuation performed on the asset. It focuses on the main metrics and output values rather than input data. For income valuation, it shows the type of method used to value the leases, along with the total rents, capitalisation rates and values.
3. **Output analysis – leases & rental information:** the table shows analytical data at the property level, seggregated for each property type, displaying the average occupancy based, gross and net rent figures, average leases duration and rent review cycles and other metrics.
4. **Output analysis – financial information:** the table shows the average net and gross initial yields of each lease based on the property final value.
