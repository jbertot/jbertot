# User Roles

Explore the flexibility of defining user roles within InterVal. This section guides you through creating and managing various roles, each with customizable access levels to system features. Learn how to tailor user permissions to enhance security and operational efficiency, ensuring that every team member has the access they need.

## 1 - Role List Table

This screenshot provides a clear view of the User Roles main page, showcasing the ease of managing different roles within the system. Here, you can create, view, edit, and delete roles based on your organizational needs and compliance requirements.

1. **Create New Role Button:** The 'New Role' button is prominently displayed for easy access to start defining a new role within your system. Click this to open the role configuration page where you can set permissions and access details.
2. **Roles Overview Table:** This section of the table lists the 'admin' role, serving as an example for how roles are organized. Each role has a unique ID and name for quick identification and management.
3. **Edit Role Button:** The pencil icon represents the edit function, allowing for modification of the roleâ€™s permissions and properties. Click here to update the role to suit changing requirements or to refine access control.
4. **Delete Role Button:** The trash bin icon is used to delete a role. It's enabled only when no users are currently assigned to the role, ensuring system integrity and preventing accidental removal of active roles.

## 2 - **Role Creation and Permissions Setup**

This interface is where the precision of user access begins. Define a new role or edit an existing one by naming it and selecting the specific permissions from the comprehensive list below.

1. **Role Name Input:** Enter a unique name for the role here. The name should reflect the level of access or the job function, such as 'Administrator' or 'Valuation Analyst.
2. **Permissions Checklist:** Check the boxes next to each page or record type to grant access. Unchecked boxes mean the role will not have any access to those items.
3. **Edit Rights Option:** When this is selected, users with the role can add, edit, or remove records on the corresponding pages, allowing full management capabilities.
4. **View-Only Rights Option:** This option limits the role to viewing records only, without the ability to make changes, suitable for roles that require oversight but not editing rights.
