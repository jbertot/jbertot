# Linked Tables

Across the InterVal system, various dropdown menu or multiple-choice fields are used. While we have tried to cover most possible choices you will need in the default settings, there might be instances where you require additional choices or drop down options. In this section, you can customize the options available dropdown menus and multiple-choice fields.

For example, if you have a property with a special flooring type like 'Italian marble' that is not listed in the default settings, you can add it directly here in the linked tables. Similarly, if there are too many options available for a particular field, causing delays in selection, you can choose to hide certain options from the system.

Review the numbered labels on the screenshots below and read the associated text to learn more about the different features on this page.

## **1 - Main Page**

The main page is organized into six different tabs where you can access the specific modules that you wish to add options to or remove options from. Alternatively, you can use the 'Type' dropdown menu to navigate the same categories listed in the tabs. Finally, you can also use the 'search' function to rapidly find a specific module and dropdown option.
