# Linked Tables

Across the system, various dropdown or multiple-choice fields are used. While we have tried to cover most possible choices you might need, there might be instances where you need additional options. For example, if you have a property with a special flooring type like Italian marble that isn't listed, you can add it directly in the linked tables. Similarly, if there are too many options available for a particular field, causing delays in selection, you can choose to hide certain options from the system.

## **1 - Main Page**

The main page is organized into several tabs where you can access the module you want to add or remove options from.
