# Templates

**The templating system can be used for Terms of Engagement (TOE), target properties, teams involved in assignments, external sources (documents) to be included in reports, adjustment types for the comparable methodology, and selection criteria. The system is designed to be expandable, and InterVal will add more templating options in the future.**

The screenshot below showcases the Templating page of InterVal, which allows users to create custom templates for various aspects of the valuation process. By tailoring the system to their specific needs, users can save time and reduce the errors associated with manual data entry.

1. **Actions Button:** Displays a dropdown menu of the types of templates that can be added, such as TOE, Target Property, Teams, External Sources, Criterions, Adjustments and Quotes.
2. **Add Template:** Clicking on a specific type of template in the dropdown menu opens the corresponding form to create a new template of that type.
3. **Template Type Tabs:** Each type of template (TOE, Target Property, Teams, External Sources, Criterions, Adjustments and Quotes) has its own tab. The tabs display all the templates associated with that specific type.
4. **Template Table:** Displays the list of templates for the selected type. Each row represents a single template, with columns providing relevant information about the template.
5. **Action Buttons:** Allows users to perform various actions on the templates, including:
   * _**Duplicate:** Creates a copy of the selected template_
   * _**View:** Displays the contents of the selected template_
   * _**Edit:** Allows users to modify the selected template_
   * _**Delete:** Removes the selected template from the system_

By utilizing the templating system, users can streamline their valuation process, especially for recurring assignments with similar properties or requirements. This not only saves time but also ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors associated with manual data entry.

As InterVal continues to develop and expand its features, more templating options will be added to further enhance the system's flexibility and adaptability to users' needs.
