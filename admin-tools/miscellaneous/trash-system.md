# Trash System

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Trash System" alt=""><figcaption><p>Trash System</p></figcaption></figure>

**The Trash Function is a system-wide feature in InterVal that allows users to delete items from various list pages, providing a safe and recoverable way to manage data. This function is available for items that are not currently being used in any active process, ensuring data integrity and preventing unintended consequences.**

**Deleting Items:** To delete an item from a list page, users can simply click on the trash icon associated with the specific item they wish to remove. This action moves the item to the trash, removing it from the active list but not permanently deleting it from the system.

**Trash System Indicator:** Once an item has been moved to the trash, a trash system indicator will appear at the top right of the page ("Trashed (x)"), displaying the number of items currently in the trash. This indicator only appears if an item has been added to the trash system. It serves as a visual reminder that there are deleted items that may require further action.

**Restoring or Permanently Deleting Items:** By clicking on the trash system indicator, users can access a modal window that presents them with two options:

1. **Restore the Item:** Choosing this option will restore the deleted item to its original location, making it once again active and accessible within the system.
2. **Permanently Delete the Item:** Selecting this option will initiate the permanent deletion process for the item. However, the item is not immediately erased from the system, providing an additional layer of protection against accidental deletions.

**Admin Trash:** In the event that a user permanently deletes an item, it is not entirely lost. The system administrator has access to the Admin Trash, where they can view all permanently deleted items and take further action. The admin user can choose to either restore the item, making it available to the original user once again, or permanently delete it from the Admin Trash.

**60-Day Retention Period:** As a final safeguard, InterVal retains permanently deleted items in the system for an additional 60 days before they are completely erased. This retention period provides a last resort for recovering accidentally deleted data, ensuring that important information is not lost forever.

**Support Team Assistance:** If a user realizes that they have accidentally deleted an item and it has been permanently removed from the Admin Trash, they can still reach out to the InterVal support team for assistance. The support team may be able to recover the deleted item within the 60-day retention period, providing a final safety net for critical data.

With the Trash Function, InterVal offers a robust and user-friendly system for managing data deletions. The multi-stage deletion process, combined with the ability to restore items at various levels and the extended retention period, ensures that users can confidently remove items from their lists without the fear of permanently losing important information. This feature enhances the overall user experience and provides peace of mind when working with valuable data within the InterVal platform.
