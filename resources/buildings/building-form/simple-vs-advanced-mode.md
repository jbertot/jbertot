# Simple Vs Advanced Mode

**The Buildings Form in InterVal is a dedicated section that allows users to input, manage, and update information about the buildings in which the properties being valued are located. It is particularly useful for properties situated within larger buildings or complexes, such as residential apartments, commercial offices, and retail spaces.**

## 1 - Simple Mode

At the top of the Buildings Form, users can choose between two modes: Simple and Advanced. The Simple mode displays only the most essential fields, such as building name, address, year built, number of floors, and basic amenities. This streamlined view is ideal for users who require a quick and focused approach to capturing key building details.

## 2 - Advanced Mode

The Advanced mode, on the other hand, provides a comprehensive set of fields to capture a wide range of building attributes, including building materials, HVAC systems, energy efficiency ratings, parking facilities, ownership history, and more. This mode is designed for valuers who require a more detailed and granular approach to building data management.

The ability to switch between Simple and Advanced modes allows users to customize the Buildings Form based on their specific valuation requirements. This flexibility ensures that valuers can efficiently manage building data while maintaining the depth of information necessary for accurate and reliable valuations.
