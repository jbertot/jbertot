# Properties List

**The Comparables Database is a crucial component of InterVal, allowing users to store, manage, and access a wide range of property data for various valuation projects. By maintaining a comprehensive database of comparables, valuers can streamline their work, ensure consistency, and make well-informed decisions based on relevant market data.**

InterVal supports multiple property types, including residential (apartments and houses), commercial (offices, retail shops, retail buildings, and parking), industrial (warehouses), and land. While each property type may have specific attributes and data fields, the overall structure and functionality of the comparables database remain consistent.

For the purpose of this documentation, we will focus on the residential property type, specifically apartments. However, the instructions and processes outlined here can be easily adapted to other property types, with minor variations in the data fields and attributes.

It is important to note that most of these properties might be located in specific buildings for which you might need to store specific information. In order to avoid duplicating your efforts, there is also a specific database with its own page/section for buildings.

Users can add comparables to the database through this dedicated section, ensuring that the information is easily accessible for future projects. Additionally, InterVal allows users to input comparables directly during the valuation process, providing a seamless and efficient workflow.

By leveraging the power of the comparables database, valuers can save time, reduce manual data entry, and make more accurate valuations based on relevant and up-to-date market information.

This screenshot showcases the Comparables Map View, which displays all the comparables for each property type on a map and as a list.

1. **Map Detail - Cluster:** Represents a group of properties located in close proximity to each other, with the number indicating the count of properties within the cluster.
2. **Map Detail - Reference Number:** Shows the unique reference number of a single property on the map. Clicking on the reference number opens a modal with more details about the property (Screenshot 3).
3. **Comparables List:** Displays the same list of properties as in Screenshot 1, number 10. However, the properties shown in this list are only those visible on the current map view.

3. **Property Details:** Shows important information about the property, such as address, size, price, and amenities.
